        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many public schools provide a free education through the government. Parents may send their own children to a private
        schools, but they must pay for it. In some poorer places, some children cannot go to school, because their countries do
        not make education available in their countries, or because their families do not have enough money, or because the
        children have to work for money, or because the society have negative prejudice on education for girls.The city of Alexandria in
        Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the
        great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and
        organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476. Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.
        Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently
        takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves.[1] Education can take place
        in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may
        be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy education in zambia. When we see that children everywhere are required by law to go to school, that almost all schools are structured in the same way, and that our society goes to a great deal of trouble and expense to provide such schools, we tend naturally to assume that there must be some good, logical reason for all this. Perhaps if we didn't force children to go to school, or if schools operated much differently, children would not grow up to be competent adults. Perhaps some really smart people have figured all this out and have proven it in some way, or perhaps alternative ways of thinking about child development and education have been tested and have failed. If we want to understand why standard schools are what they are, we have to abandon the idea that they are products of logical necessity or scientific insight. They are, instead, products of history. Schooling, as it exists today, only makes sense if we view it from a historical perspective. And so, as a first step toward explaining why schools are what they are, I present here, in a nutshell, an outline of the history of education, from the beginning of humankind until now. Most scholars of educational history would use different terms than I use here, but I doubt that they would deny the overall accuracy of the sketch. In fact, I have used the writings of such scholars to help me develop the sketch. </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge,
        values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could
        be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
        Kingdom. In recent times, the methods of schooling have become less harsh, but basic assumptions have not changed. Learning continues to be defined as children's work, and power-assertive means are used to make children do that work. School today is the place where all children learn the distinction that hunter-gatherers never knewâ€”the distinction between work and play. The teacher says, "you must do your work and then you can play." Clearly, according to this message, work, which encompasses all of school learning, is something that one does not want to do but must; and play, which is everything that one wants to do, has relatively little value. Repetition and memorization of lessons is tedious work for children, whose instincts urge them constantly to play freely and explore the world on their own. Just as children did not adapt readily to laboring in fields and factories, they did not adapt readily to schooling. This was no surprise to the adults involved. That, perhaps, is the leading lesson of our method of schooling. If children learn nothing else in school, they learn the difference between work and play and that learning is work, not play. Clever educators today might use "play" as a tool to get children to enjoy some of their lessons, and children might be allowed some free playtime at recess (though even this is decreasing in very recent times), but children's own play is certainly understood as inadequate as a foundation for education. In the beginning, for hundreds of thousands of years, children educated themselves through self-directed play and exploration.Children whose drive to play is so strong that they can't sit still for lessons are no longer beaten; instead, they are medicated.</p>

            In ancient India, education was mainly imparted through the Vedic and Buddhist education system. Sanskrit was the language used to impart the Vedic education system. In the Vedic system, a child started his education at the age of five, whereas in the Buddhist system the child started his education at the age of eight. The main aim of education in ancient India was to develop a person's character, master the art of self-control, bring about social awareness, and to conserve and take forward ancient culture.
